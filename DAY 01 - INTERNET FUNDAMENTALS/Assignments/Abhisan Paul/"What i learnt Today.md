>## **DNS**
### **What is DNS ?**
#### The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.Humans access information online through domain names, like abcd.com,wxyz.com etc. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device.
#### IP addresses such as **192.168.1.1** (in IPv4), or alphanumeric IP addresses such as **2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2** (in IPv6).

### **How does DNS work ?**
* The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). 
* An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device.In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different hardware components a DNS query must pass between.

>## **DNS resolver**
### **What is a DNS resolver ?**
#### The DNS resolver is the first stop in the DNS lookup, and it is responsible for dealing with the client that made the initial request. The resolver starts the sequence of queries that ultimately leads to a URL being translated into the necessary IP address.
#### **It's important to differentiate between a recursive DNS query and a recursive DNS resolver.** 
* #### The query refers to the request made to a DNS resolver requiring the resolution of the query. A DNS recursive resolver is the computer that accepts a recursive query and processes the response by making the necessary requests.
#### **In a typical DNS lookup three types of queries occur :**
* Recursive query
* Iterative query
* Non-recursive query

### **Recursive DNS resolver :**
#### The recursive resolver is the computer that responds to a recursive request from a client and takes the time to track down the DNS record. It does this by making a series of requests until it reaches the authoritative DNS nameserver for the requested record.

### **How to check IP address for PC CMD ?**
1. Right click the windows button in the lower left of your screen.
1. Select command prompt from the list.
1. A black and white window will open where you will type ipconfig /all and press enter.
1. There is a space between the command ipconfig and the switch of /all.
1. When a technician requests the IP address of your Ethernet card, the information that follows after the title of Ethernet.

>## **HTTP Request Method**
### **What is HTTP Request Method ?**
#### The client’s request is an HTTP Request, and HTTP request methods contain information about the specific action that needs to be performed.
### **What Are HTTP Request Methods ?**
* HTTP refers to the format used to consolidate requests and responses to enable communication between a server and the client. The client’s message or request sent to the server is an HTTP request.
* The client always receives a response to the request, indicating whether the request has failed or been fulfilled. The server performs the desired action and sends a response code when the request is completed.
#### **There are four parts of HTTP requests and responses :**
1. The first line indicates a request URL or request’s method or carry’s the response code indicating failure or success of the request
1. A header contains the details of the message or request made by the client.
1. A blank line containing meta-information is sent to the server. 
1. The message body contains data relevant to the request, such as documents or web form data related to the response that will be displayed to the client.
### **How to Use an HTTP Request Method ?**
### **GET**
#### GET is one of the most commonly employed HTTP request methods that sends a request to servers to access certain information on the server. For example, you want to send a request for access to Instagram. In the browser, the request “https://www.instagram.com” will be known as sending a GET request to the Instagram server, requesting a response for the Instagram homepage. 
### **POST**
#### Post is another widely used HTTP request that transports data from the client to the server. Take the example of your favorite brand’s cart page in which you are submitting details, such as your phone number, name, and address.
### **PUT**
#### PUT and POST are similar request methods in which data or information is transferred to the server. However, the PUT method is commonly used to update information rather than add new data to the server. The PUT method will update the phone number, name, and address already added to the server.  
### **Delete**
#### As the name suggests, the delete request method removes data from the server. For example, you have posted a picture on Facebook, and now you want to delete it. The request you will send to the Facebook server will be “Delete.”
### **Why Do We Need HTTP Request Methods ?**
1. HTTP request methods are means of communication between the server and the client to access resources from the web. The request to access could include anything from database data to HTML files and so on. 
1. HTTP request methods determine the specific action to access a resource and send a relevant response to the client.

>## **HTTP request status code**
#### HTTP status codes are like short notes from a server that get tacked onto a web page. They’re not actually part of the site’s content. Instead, it received the request to view a certain page.

>## **PORT**
### **What is a port ?**
#### A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. 
### **What is a port number ?**
#### Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain protocols.
#### There are 65,535 possible port numbers, although not all are in common use. Some of the most commonly used ports, along with their associated networking protocol, are:

#### Computer networks are the basis of communication in IT.A computer network is a set of computers that are connected so they can share information.
### **What Do Networks Do ?**
#### Networks are used for:
* Communicating using email, video, instant messaging, and other methods
* Sharing devices such as printers, scanners, and photocopiers
* Sharing files
* Sharing software and operating programs on remote systems.
### **Types of Networks :**
#### There are many types of networks, which are used for various purposes by different personnel and organizations. The different types of networks are :
* **Local Area Networks (LAN)** :
A local area network or LAN is a network that connects computers within a limited area. This might be in a school, an office, or even a home.
* **Personal Area Networks (PAN)** :
A personal area network is a network that is based on an individual's workspace. There are also wireless personal area networks.
* **Home Area Networks (HAN)** :
A home area network connects devices within a home environment.
* **Wide Area Networks (WAN)** :
A wide area network is a network that covers a larger geographical area, usually with a radius of more than a mile.
* **Campus Networks** :
A campus network is a LAN or set of connected LANs that is used by a government agency, university, corporation etc.
* **Enterprise Private Networks** :
An enterprise private network is used by a company to connect its various sites so that the different locations can share resources.
* **Internetworks** :
Internetworks connect different networks together to build a larger network. Internetworking is often used to describe building a large, global network.
* **Global Area Networks (GAN)** :
A global area network is a worldwide network that connects networks all over the globe, such as the internet.
* **Backbone Networks (BBN)** :
A backbone is a part of a network that connects different devices and provides a path for information to be exchanged.
* **Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)** :
