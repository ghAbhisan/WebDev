>## **HTTP Vs HTTPS**
### **What is HTTP ?**
#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes
### **What is HTTPS ?**
#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a protocol that secures communication and data transfer between a user's web browser and a website. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. The protocol protects users against eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

### **About HTTP Request Methods !**
### **GET**
#### GET is one of the most commonly employed HTTP request methods that sends a request to servers to access certain information on the server. For example, you want to send a request for access to Amazon. In the browser, the request “https://www.amazon.in” will be known as sending a GET request to the AWS server, requesting a response for the Amazon homepage. 
### **POST**
#### Post is another widely used HTTP request that transports data from the client to the server. Take the example of your favorite brand’s cart page in which you are submitting details, such as your phone number, name, and address.
### **PUT**
#### PUT and POST are similar request methods in which data or information is transferred to the server. However, the PUT method is commonly used to update information rather than add new data to the server. The PUT method will update the phone number, name, and address already added to the server.  
### **Delete**
#### As the name suggests, the delete request method removes data from the server. For example, you have posted a picture on Facebook, and now you want to delete it. The request you will send to the Facebook server will be “Delete.”

#### What is a HTTP status code?
An HTTP status code is a server response to a browser's request. When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the site's server, and the server then responds to the browser's request with a three-digit code: the HTTP status code

>## **PORT**
### **What is a port ?**
#### A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service 
### **What is a port number ?**
#### Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain protocols — for example, all Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages go to port 80. While IP addresses enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices.
