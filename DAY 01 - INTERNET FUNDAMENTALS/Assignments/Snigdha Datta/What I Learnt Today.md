 WHAT I HAVE LEARNT TODAY :-

1) ISP   2)DNS   3)HTTP vs HTTPS   4)HTTP Status Codes   5)PORTS    6)CHECK IP CMD



1) WHAT IS AN ISP ?

ISP is  basically a company which provides services to cutsomers  means us who need internet or any services/fuctions performed by the use of internet. That is why it is called 
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP)... Now someone may have the querry that why we need any source or company which provides us internet because we know ineternet is accessible to all, but the
thing is that we are thinking it is available to us as someone(ISP) is providing it to us like in real world we all need someone or any source who make the facilities of different things available 
to us... Examples like you want to host a server under your own name i.e a website so you need to buy that domain under your name or your company name from the ISP, so common things where we 
need ISP are WEBSITE HOSTING, EMAIL HOSTING, MOBILE RECHARGE FACILITIES, WIFI FACILITIES, ETC. 


2) WHAT IS A DNS ?

DNS is DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM. Basically domain means something under your control or under your name/ your supervision i.e something on which no one else has right except 
you.. Therefore from here it is clear that DNS is a system that provides anything under your domain ehich is uniquely owned by you i.e in buisensess which we commonly refer
to as patent. Suppose any company wants to host their website so they buy that service from ISP through DNS i.e DNS is connected to ISP. the website address of any comoany where
we see www.<name of the company>.com , this web address which is uniquely under the comopany's name(domain) which can't be forged by any other third party is brought with the
help of DNS through ISP or any other service provider.
  
3) DIFFERENCE B/W HTTP & HTTPS.
  
HTTP is HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL & HTTPS is HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE. By the fullforms only it's visible what is the difference . HTTPS is basically the 
  encrypted form of HTTP.. HTTP was used earlier in ip adresses which was more prone to hackers but now it is a bit less due to encrypted version..
  
4) WHAT ARE HTTP STATUS CODES ?

HTTP STATUS CODES basically are some numerical or text form of codes which is shown when a website is run to show thw condition of the website. for website's sucessful running
a http code is shown on the user's screen , when the website doesn't run becuase the the servers problem a code called 404 NOT FOUND is shown, so for different states of a website
  various codes are shown which are unique for each case.
  
5) WHAT ARE PORTS ? 
 
PORTS are basically a unique route following which a task or anything on internet specified to that port can be performed i.e a route following which you raech your destination
  on the internet . Eg: i want to reach a specific router then i have to write the port that is assigned to that router , if i write any othervport to which the router
  is not assigned then we will not reach that router.
  
Ports 20 and 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP). ...
Port 22: Secure Shell (SSH). ...
Port 25: Historically, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). ...
Port 53: Domain Name System (DNS).
  
  
6) HOW TO CHECK IP USING CMD ?
  
In windows 10 Open the Command Prompt.  
a. Click the Start icon, type command prompt into the search bar and press click the Command Prompt icon.
b. Type ipconfig/all and press Enter.
